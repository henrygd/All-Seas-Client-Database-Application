Secure web application made for a cruise-focused travel agency that makes it easy to add, remove, update, or search for client information. Also allows the user to download a backup of the database or export it as a spreadsheet.

It can be tested [here](https://clientdb.herokuapp.com). Username / password is "test". It's hosted on Heroku so it may take a moment to 'wake up,' but you may alter the database in any way you want. The data will be reset after a short period of time.

Built with [Flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask) and uses [NProgress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress) for ajax loading effect.
